Sohrab Namazi Nia, last 4 digits of NJIT ID: 6387

I HAVE READ THE COLLABORATION SECTION OF THE SYLLABUS. DOCUMENT 3 and PRP
ADHERED.

POINTS:
My code is highly object oriented. I have not used any specific packages to avoid making this code only runnable for some special versions. 
it only consists of one java file + this text file
Also, I have tested my code on NJIT linux machine.
The implementation is exactly in the same way is it was described not only in the lecture notes but also in the prp documentation.
I also dic my best to write a very high level clean code to descrive the functionality of hash tables properly.

IMPORTANT:
after deleting a word, I also replace it by stars(*) in the array A. 
example: 
alex/tom/sohrab/
after deleting tom
alex/***/sohrab/

HOW TO RUN IT?
javac Main.java
java -classpath . Main file.txt

-- file.txt can be also a file path + name of a file as well. Anyway, if the file is in the same directory, there is no need to give the path.
For example: if the file name is test.txt and it is in the same folder as the Main.java, you only need to type the following command for running that (after compiling):
java -classpath . Main test.txt

THANK YOU!
